# trackd
Trackd is a blog for music-listening list-makers and a great place for you to consolidate your thoughts on whatever the most noteworthy tracks of a genre, subgenre, or given topic are. You can create tracklists and add however many songs you think should be given the spotlight. All the dated curations are put in their own chronological list, making Trackd your own personal music-listening diary!

## Usage
With Maven installed, open the terminal to the trackd subdirectory and run `mvn package`. Once that completes, run the app with `mvn spring-boot:run`.
